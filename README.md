## About The Project

This bot is a little project I've started to automize muting for Teamspeak3. There are a lot of bots for discord but we like to use Teamspeak thats why I tried to come up with this bot.

This bot works with the AmongUsCapture and uses it's WebSocket to gather Among Us game events.
